# Python Projects

This repository contains my Python code.

## Beginner

- **Hypotenuse Calculator:** Calculate the hypotenuse by entering the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle.
- **Event Time Calculator:** Calculates the end time by adding event duration (in minutes) to the starting time (hours and minutes).
- **Leap Year Checker:** Determines whether a given year is a leap year based on Gregorian calendar rules.
- **Mississippi Count:** Demonstrates the use of a for loop and the time.sleep() function to simulate real-time counting, as in the "one Mississippi, two Mississippi" style.
- **Remove Vowels:** A beginner-friendly Python program that removes all vowels from a word using a loop and the continue statement.
- **Pyramid Height Calculator:** Determines how many full pyramid levels can be built with a given number of blocks using a while loop and step-by-step block accumulation.
- **Collatz Conjecture:** A program that tests the Collatz hypothesis by repeatedly applying the rules for even and odd numbers, counting the steps taken to reach 1.
- **Number_List_Tuple:** Starts with a list of numbers, replaces the middle element with user input, removes the last item, adds new elements using different list methods, converts the list to a tuple, and prints the final tuple along with its length.
- **Beatles_List_Builder:**"A basic list-manipulation exercise that builds a list of Beatles members based on a predefined scenario. Covers append, extend, delete, insert, and slicing techniques."
- **Bubble Sort Variants:** Demonstrates three ways to sort user-provided numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm—by taking input one-by-one, as a comma-separated string with manual sorting, and with Python’s built-in sort method.
