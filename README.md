# Python Projects

This repository contains my Python code.

## Beginner

- **Hypotenuse Calculator:** Calculate the hypotenuse by entering the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle.
- **Event Time Calculator:** Calculates the end time by adding event duration (in minutes) to the starting time (hours and minutes).
- **Leap Year Checker:** Determines whether a given year is a leap year based on Gregorian calendar rules.
- **Mississippi Count:** Demonstrates the use of a for loop and the time.sleep() function to simulate real-time counting, as in the "one Mississippi, two Mississippi" style.
- **Remove Vowels:** A beginner-friendly Python program that removes all vowels from a word using a loop and the continue statement.
- **Pyramid Height Calculator:** Determines how many full pyramid levels can be built with a given number of blocks using a while loop and step-by-step block accumulation.
- **Collatz Conjecture:** A program that tests the Collatz hypothesis by repeatedly applying the rules for even and odd numbers, counting the steps taken to reach 1.
- **Number_List_Tuple:** Starts with a list of numbers, replaces the middle element with user input, removes the last item, adds new elements using different list methods, converts the list to a tuple, and prints the final tuple along with its length.
- **Beatles_List_Builder:**"A basic list-manipulation exercise that builds a list of Beatles members based on a predefined scenario. Covers append, extend, delete, insert, and slicing techniques."
- **Bubble Sort Variants:** Demonstrates three ways to sort user-provided numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm—by taking input one-by-one, as a comma-separated string with manual sorting, and with Python’s built-in sort method.
- **Unique Elements Filter:** Iterates through a list and builds a new one by appending only the first occurrence of each number.
- **Day of the Year Calculator:** A function-based program that calculates the day number within the year for any given date (year, month, day). It correctly handles leap years according to the Gregorian calendar and validates input values to ensure accurate results.
- **Fuel Conversion:** Converts between liters per 100 km and miles per gallon using two simple functions with unit conversion based on international standards.
- **Tic Toc Toe:** A terminal-based two-player game against the computer. The board is displayed using ASCII characters. The player and computer take turns placing 'O' and 'X' respectively. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw). Includes input validation and graceful quit option (q or Q).

## Intermediate

- **My Split:** A custom implementation of the Python `split()` method without using the built-in function. It splits a string into words based on spaces, handling empty strings and multiple spaces gracefully. This project is from the Cisco Python Essential 2 course.
